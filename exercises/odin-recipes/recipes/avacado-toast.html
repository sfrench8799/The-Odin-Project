    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Avocado toast, a contemporary culinary sensation, is a simple yet indulgent dish that has taken the breakfast and brunch scene by storm. A slice of hearty, toasted bread serves as the canvas for this creation, adorned with ripe, creamy avocado slices. Mashed or sliced, the avocado is generously spread over the warm toast, creating a velvety, green layer. The dish is often elevated with additional toppings such as a sprinkle of sea salt, a dash of black pepper, red pepper flakes, or a drizzle of olive oil. Some variations may include a poached or fried egg on top, adding a luscious richness to the ensemble. Avocado toast not only delights the taste buds with its harmonious blend of textures and flavors but also boasts a nutritious profile, making it a beloved and Instagram-worthy breakfast choice for health-conscious food enthusiasts.</p>
